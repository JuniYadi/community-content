## Introduction

Before you start installing wordpress cms on the server, you must meet the following conditions :

**Prerequisites**
* Server with Operating System Linux CentOS 7 [Minimal Installation ISO](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1810.iso)
* LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), [if you don't have it installed, please follow this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-lamp-server-on-centos-7)
* Root access
* SSH Tools
  * [Putty For Windows](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
  * OpenSSH in Linux/macOS (available by default)

In the previous [LAMP STACK tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-lamp-server-on-centos-7), we have created domain example.com and holu.example.com, then in this tutorial, we will install on both the index domain and the sub domain.

**information from the LAMP Stack that will be used**
* Index Domain : example.com
* Sub Domain   : holu.example.com
* MySQL root password : holuP455##

## Step 1 - Create MySQL Database User and Password

### Step 1.1 - Login to Database with MySQL root Account
```bash
mysql -uroot -p
```

### Step 1.2 - Create User and Password

* For example.com :
```bash
CREATE USER 'example'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#TH15exmp#';
```

* For holu.example.com
```bash
CREATE USER 'holu'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#TH15holu#';
```

Example output of the command:
```bash
mysql> CREATE USER 'example'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#TH15exmp#';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> CREATE USER 'holu'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#TH15holu#';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```
### Step 1.3 - Create Database

```bash
CREATE DATABASE exampledb;
CREATE DATABASE holudb;
```
Example output of the command:
```bash
mysql> CREATE DATABASE exampledb;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> CREATE DATABASE holudb;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

### Step 1.4 - Give User Right Access

This command, will allow user to create, delete, 

```bash
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exampledb.* TO 'example'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON holudb.* TO 'holu'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

To save all changes, run the following command:
```
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Note : 
In the example above, we give users full access to the database, I suggest giving full access if this is on the production server. if you want to provide other access, please check the list below :

* ALL PRIVILEGES : Account will get full access to MySQL Database or Table. (Grant all privileges at specified access level except GRANT OPTION and PROXY.)
* GRANT OPTION : Enable privileges to be granted to or removed from other accounts. Levels: Global, database, table, routine, proxy.
* CREATE : Enable database and table creation. Levels: Global, database, table.
* DELETE : Enable use of DELETE. Level: Global, database, table.
* DROP : Enable databases, tables, and views to be dropped. Levels: Global, database, table.
* INSERT : Enable use of INSERT. Levels: Global, database, table, column.
* SELECT : Enable use of SELECT. Levels: Global, database, table, column.
* UPDATE : Enable use of UPDATE. Levels: Global, database, table, column.

if you want other access, please check the reference directly [from MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/grant.html#grant-privileges)

Example output of the command:
```bash
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exampledb.* TO 'example'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON holudb.* TO 'holu'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```
Then exit mysql with the command: `quit`

## Step 2 - Install & Configure Wordpress

### Step 2.1 - Download Wordpress & Extract
```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xvf latest.tar.gz
cd wordpress
```

### Step 2.2 - Copy Wordpress Files to Public Html and Apache Access

* For example.com:
```bash
cp -r * /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
find /var/www/html/example.com/public_html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find /var/www/html/example.com/public_html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

```

* For holu.example.com:
```bash
cp -r * /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html
find /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

### Step 2.3 - Configure Wordpress

Now access your website from the browser, enter the website address if it displays the standard wordpress page, this means the installation is correct

![First Page Wordpress](images/01-first-page-wp.png)

Click `Let's go` to continue next page

![Database Configuration](images/02-example-db-configure.png)

![Database Configuration Success](images/03-db-configure-success.png)

On this page you have to set the website details, username and password.

![Wordpress Site Configuration](images/04-wp-site-configure.png)

A page will appear like this if the website data is correct

![Wordpress Site Configuration Success](images/05-wp-site-configure-success.png)

You will be directed to the login page, then enter the data according to your configuration on the previous page

![Wordpress Login Pages](images/06-wp-login-pages.png)

Repeat step 2.3 for the website holu.example.com or another website if you want to add other websites.

## (Optional) Step 3 - Error When Installing

### Database Error

If in the installation process it turns out you get an error as below:

![Wordpress Login Pages](images/07-db-error.png)

If you use MySQL v.8 same as [LAMP STACK tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-lamp-server-on-centos-7), follow the steps below to fix it.

Edit your mysql configuration:
```bash
nano /etc/my.cnf
```

Add this line, under `[mysqld]`:
```bash
[mysqld]
default_authentication_plugin = mysql_native_password
```

Restart MySQL Services:
```bash
systemctl restart mysqld
```

Login to MySQL and force MySQL to use native password for user:
```
mysql -uroot -p
ALTER USER 'example'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '#TH15exmp#';
```

Done, now repeat database configuration in wordpress setup.

### Can't Write wp-config.php

![Cannot Write WP Config](images/08-wp-cannot-write.png)

This will be a serious problem because wordpress can't write any file to the server, to fix it, check the user access to your file directory:

```bash
ls -lha /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
```

Example output of the command:
```bash
total 1.6M
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Mar 17 00:27 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4.0K Mar 14 08:43 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 385K Mar 20 10:51 error.log
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4.0K Mar 20 10:53 public_html
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.2M Mar 20 11:14 requests.log
```

Run the following command to fix user access:

```bash
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
```

Example output of the command:
```bash
total 1.6M
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4.0K Mar 17 00:27 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root   root   4.0K Mar 14 08:43 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   385K Mar 20 10:51 error.log
drwxr-xr-x 5 apache apache 4.0K Mar 20 10:53 public_html
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   1.2M Mar 20 11:14 requests.log
```

Automatically the file in the public_html folder will have apache permissions. So wordpress can write php, upload and other files.

## Conclusion

Your server is now ready for use with the wordpress cms website. You can also add other websites with the same steps.
