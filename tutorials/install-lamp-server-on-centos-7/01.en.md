# Installing LAMP on Centos 7

## Introduction

Before we start to build a website on our server, we need some applications, to run whatever a website need, like "web server, database, and programming language". In this tutorial, we will explain how to install LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) for single or multiple site.

**Prerequisites**
* Server with Operating System Linux Centos 7 [Minimal Installion ISO](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1810.iso)
* Root access
* SSH Tools 
  * [Putty For Windows](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
  * (Default available) OpenSSH in Linux/Mac OS

## Step 1 - Login and Update System

Before we start, make sure your system has the latest updates for version of centos 7 installed.

```
yum update -y
```

If you want install in server / vps, make sure you login first via SSH and then run the command above.

SSH login using a terminal:
```
ssh root@10.0.0.1
```

* 10.0.0.1 is your servers IP address

## Step 2 - Install LAMP

Before installing, make sure your centos has `wget` and the `nano` text editor installed. If not, install with the following command:

```
yum install wget nano -y
```    

### Install Web Server: Apache

```
yum install httpd -y
```

After the installation has finished, we need to start the httpd service with following command

```
systemctl start httpd
```
Now open your servers IP address in your browser. If it shows the apache default page, the installation was successful. We need to make sure, httpd is running after booting if we restart our server.

```
systemctl enable httpd
```
If httpd is not running, you can check if your server has another service running on port 80 with the command `netstat -tulpen | grep 80`

```
systemctl status httpd
```

Example output of the command
```
[root@your_host ~]# systemctl status httpd
● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server

Mar 14 08:13:09 your_host systemd[1]: Starting The Apache HTTP Server...
Mar 14 08:13:10 your_host systemd[1]: Started The Apache HTTP Server.
```

### Install MySQL

```
wget https://repo.mysql.com//mysql80-community-release-el7-2.noarch.rpm
yum localinstall mysql80-community-release-el7-2.noarch.rpm
yum install mysql-community-server -y
```

We need to start MySQL and enable it by default

```
systemctl start mysqld
systemctl enable mysqld
```

Example output of the command
```
[root@localhost ~]# systemctl status mysqld
● mysqld.service - MySQL Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/mysqld.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2019-03-14 08:17:19 EDT; 19s ago
     Docs: man:mysqld(8)
           http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/using-systemd.html
 Main PID: 15425 (mysqld)
   Status: "SERVER_OPERATING"
   CGroup: /system.slice/mysqld.service
           └─15425 /usr/sbin/mysqld

Mar 14 08:17:13 localhost systemd[1]: Starting MySQL Server...
Mar 14 08:17:19 localhost systemd[1]: Started MySQL Server.
```

### Login to MySQL 

By default, MySQL will create a temporary password for root, you can check it with this command:

```
grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
```

To login, we need to run:
```
mysql -uroot -p
```
Now enter the temporary password. After login, you can change the password (recommended), with this command (start from ALTER):

```
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'holuP455##';
```
* holuP455## => change to your own password, it's just an example

Password needs unique charactera, otherwise it will prompt an error like this:

```
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'holuP455';
ERROR 1819 (HY000): Your password does not satisfy the current policy requirements

mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'holuP455##';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

To exit from mysql, run the command: `quit`

### Install PHP

Before we install PHP, we need to activate epel and remi, to make sure we get the latest PHP. If we are using the default repository, it will install PHP 5.4 (too old).

```
yum install epel-release -y
yum localinstall http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm
yum install yum-utils -y
yum-config-manager --enable remi-php72
yum update -y
```

Now run this command to install PHP 7.2 + MySQL Module :
```
yum install php72 php72-php-mysqlnd -y
```

Verify the PHP version with the command `php -v`:
```
[root@localhost ~]# php -v
PHP 7.2.16 (cli) (built: Mar  5 2019 14:45:10) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies
```

If you need more php modules, you can search them with the command:
```
yum search php72 | more

or 

yum install php72 php72-php-fpm php72-php-gd php72-php-json php72-php-mbstring php72-php-mysqlnd php72-php-xml php72-php-xmlrpc php72-php-opcache php72-php-pdo -y
```

### Install phpMyAdmin (Optional)

```
yum install phpMyAdmin -y
```

You can't access phpMyAdmin directly after the installation has finished. We need to edit the httpd conf before it can be accessed. Execute the command:
```
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpMyAdmin.conf
```

and check this config. Add "Require all granted" to the config.

```
<Directory /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/>
   AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

   <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
     # Apache 2.4
     <RequireAny>
       Require ip 127.0.0.1
       Require ip ::1
       Require all granted <= add this line for allow all access
     </RequireAny>
   </IfModule>
```

To access phpMyAdmin, enter the following URL in your browser : http://10.0.0.1/phpmyadmin 

## Step 3 - Configuring Multiple Site

Now, we need setup a virtual host, this need if you want using single server for multiple site domain name, example : 

* Index Domain : example.com
* Sub Domain   : holu.example.com

#### Create Directory
```
mkdir -p /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
mkdir -p /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html
```

#### Create Example PHP Files
```
echo "<?php echo 'This is example.com'; ?>" > /var/www/html/example.com/public_html/index.php
echo "<?php echo 'This is holu.example.com'; ?>" > /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html/index.php 
```
#### Httpd Conf

We need to create new config files. 

* For example.com
```
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/example.conf
```

then, paste this config :

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example.com
    ServerAlias example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
    ErrorLog /var/www/html/example.com/error.log
</VirtualHost>
```

* For holu.example.com
```
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/holu.example.conf
```

then, paste this config :

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.holu.example.com
    ServerAlias holu.example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html
    ErrorLog /var/www/html/holu.example.com/error.log
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Restart Services HTTPD

```
systemctl restart httpd
```

Now you can access both domains, example.com or holu.example.com, with a single server.

* if you want save all php files, html, css, or js, make sure you save in public_html.
* if you need to add more sites, just repeat step 3 with another name in the conf and the folder.

## Conclusion

Your server is now ready to start to build a multiple-site with static or dynamic content. This all is possible with a single server by using Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
