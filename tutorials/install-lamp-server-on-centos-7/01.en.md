# Installing LAMP on Centos 7

## Introduction

Before we start build a website in our server, we need some application to run what we are website need, like "web server, database, and program language". in this tutorial, we will explain how to install LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) for single or multiple site.

**Prerequisites**
* Server with Operating System Linux Centos 7 [Minimal Install](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1810.iso)
* Root access
* SSH Tools 
  * [Putty For Windows](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
  * (Default available) Terminal in Linux/Mac OS

## Step 1 - <Login and Update System>

Before we start everything, make sure your system in latest version of centos 7.

```
yum update -y
```

if you want install in server / vps, make sure your login first via ssh then run command above.

Command login using terminal :
```
ssh root@10.0.0.1
```

* 10.0.0.1 is your server ip 

## Step 2 - <Install LAMP>

before installing, make sure in your centos have wget and nano text editor. if not, install with this command :
```
yum install wget nano -y
```    

### Install Web Server: Apache

```
yum install httpd -y
```

After installation finish, we need to start httpd service with command 
```
systemctl start httpd
```
Now, input your ip-server to browser, if it's show like page testing or other, installation success. We need to make sure, httpd running after boot if we restart our server.
```
systemctl enable httpd
```
if httpd not running, you can check maybe in your server has service running on port 80 with command
```
systemctl status httpd
```

Example output status httpd 
```
[root@localhost ~]# systemctl status httpd
● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2019-03-14 08:13:10 EDT; 4s ago
     Docs: man:httpd(8)
           man:apachectl(8)
 Main PID: 15255 (httpd)
   Status: "Processing requests..."
   CGroup: /system.slice/httpd.service

           ├─15259 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
           └─15260 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND

Mar 14 08:13:09 localhost systemd[1]: Starting The Apache HTTP Server...
Mar 14 08:13:10 localhost systemd[1]: Started The Apache HTTP Server.
```

### Install MySQL

```
wget https://repo.mysql.com//mysql80-community-release-el7-2.noarch.rpm
yum localinstall mysql80-community-release-el7-2.noarch.rpm
yum install mysql-community-server -y
```

We need to start MySQL and enable by default

```
systemctl start mysqld
systemctl enable mysqld
```

Example output status MySQL
```
[root@localhost ~]# systemctl status mysqld
● mysqld.service - MySQL Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/mysqld.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2019-03-14 08:17:19 EDT; 19s ago
     Docs: man:mysqld(8)
           http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/using-systemd.html
 Main PID: 15425 (mysqld)
   Status: "SERVER_OPERATING"
   CGroup: /system.slice/mysqld.service
           └─15425 /usr/sbin/mysqld

Mar 14 08:17:13 localhost systemd[1]: Starting MySQL Server...
Mar 14 08:17:19 localhost systemd[1]: Started MySQL Server.
```

### Login to MySQL 

By default, MySQL will create temporary password for root, you can check with this command :

```
grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
```

Now, to login, we need to run :
```
mysql -uroot -p
```
enter temporary password .. and after login, you can change temporary password (recomended), in mysql (after login), run this command (start from ALTER):
```
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'holuP455##';
```
* holuP455## => change to your own password, it's just example

Password need unique character, if not, it's will prompt error like this :
```
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'holuP455';
ERROR 1819 (HY000): Your password does not satisfy the current policy requirements

mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'holuP455##';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

to exit from mysql, run command : quit

### Install PHP

Before install php, we need active epel and remi, to make sure we get latest php, or if we are using default repo, it will become to PHP 5.4 (too old).

```
yum install epel-release -y
yum localinstall http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm
yum install yum-utils -y
yum-config-manager --enable remi-php72
yum update -y
```

Now run this command to install PHP 7.2 + MySQL Module :
```
yum install php72 php72-php-mysqlnd -y
```

Verify php version by command "php -v" :
```
[root@localhost ~]# php -v
PHP 7.2.16 (cli) (built: Mar  5 2019 14:45:10) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies
```

if you need more module php, you can search by command :
```
yum search php72 | more

or 

yum install php72 php72-php-fpm php72-php-gd php72-php-json php72-php-mbstring php72-php-mysqlnd php72-php-xml php72-php-xmlrpc php72-php-opcache php72-php-pdo -y
```

### Install phpMyAdmin (Optional)

```
yum install phpMyAdmin -y
```

you can't access directly phpmyadmin after installation finished, we need edit httpd conf before it's can be access. command :
```
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpMyAdmin.conf
```

and check this config, add "Require all granted" in config.

```
<Directory /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/>
   AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

   <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
     # Apache 2.4
     <RequireAny>
       Require ip 127.0.0.1
       Require ip ::1
       Require all granted <= add this line for allow all access
     </RequireAny>
   </IfModule>
```

to access phpmyadmin, enter url in browser : http://<ip-server>/phpmyadmin 

## Step 3 - Configuring Multiple Site

Now, we need setup a virtual host, this need if you want using single server for multiple site domain name, example : 

* Index Domain : example.com
* Sub Domain   : holu.example.com

#### Create Directory
```
mkdir -p /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
mkdir -p /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html
```

#### Create Example PHP Files
```
echo "<?php echo 'This is example.com'; ?>" > /var/www/html/example.com/public_html/index.php
echo "<?php echo 'This is holu.example.com'; ?>" > /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html/index.php 
```
#### Httpd Conf

We need to create new config files. 

* For example.com
```
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/example.conf
```

then, paste this config :

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example.com
    ServerAlias example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
    ErrorLog /var/www/html/example.com/error.log
</VirtualHost>
```

* For holu.example.com
```
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/holu.example.conf
```

then, paste this config :

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.holu.example.com
    ServerAlias holu.example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html
    ErrorLog /var/www/html/holu.example.com/error.log
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Restart Services HTTPD

```
systemctl restart httpd
```

Now you can access both of domain example.com or holu.example.com with single server.

* if you want save all php files, html, css, or js, make sure you save in public_html.
* if you need add more site, just repeat step 3 with another name conf and folder.

## Conclusion

You're server now ready to start build a multiple-site static or dynamic from single server by using Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
