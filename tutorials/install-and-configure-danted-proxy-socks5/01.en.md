## Introduction

Before you start installing the Danted Proxy Socks5 on the server, you must meet the following conditions:

**Prerequisites**
* Server with Operating System Linux :
  * Debian 9
  * Ubuntu 18.04
* Root access
* SSH Tools
  * [Putty For Windows](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
  * OpenSSH in Linux/macOS (available by default)

## Step 1 - Install Danted

```bash
apt update
apt install danted-server -y
```

When the installation is complete, you will see that Danted has encountered an error, because it was not configured yet.

Check Danted Version :
```bash
// Debian 9
root@your_host:~# danted -v
Dante v1.4.1


// Ubuntu 18.04
root@your_host:~# danted -v
Dante v1.4.2
```

When installing Danted using apt on debian 9 and ubuntu there are differences in versions, in debian 9 the Danted version namely 1.4.1 is different from ubuntu 18.04 which is 1.4.2. Full details about release information are [HERE](https://www.inet.no/dante/).

## Step 2 - Configure Danted

### Step 2.1 - Internet Interface

We must check the server interface, in the example below, the server uses the `eth0` interface.

```bash
root@your_host:~# ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:50:56:06:d1:d0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.0.0.1/24 brd 10.0.0.1 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

### Step 2.2 - Configuration Danted

Before we change the configuration, we must make a backup configuration file, because in the configuration file there is information about the functions of each configuration line.

```bash
mv /etc/danted.conf /etc/danted.conf.bak
```

Then we edit the Danted configuration

```bash
nano /etc/danted.conf
```

Copy and Paste the configuration below:

```
logoutput: /var/log/socks.log
internal: eth0 port = 1080
external: eth0
clientmethod: none
socksmethod: none
user.privileged: root
user.notprivileged: nobody

client pass {
        from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
        log: error connect disconnect
}
client block {
        from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
        log: connect error
}
socks pass {
        from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
        log: error connect disconnect
}
socks block {
        from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
        log: connect error
}
```

Configuration Notes
* If your server does not use the eth0 interfaces, change it in the section `internal` and `external`.
* If you want another port, change in `port = 1080` to port you want it.

Start and check if Danted running normally:

```bash
systemctl start danted
systemctl status danted
```

### Step 2.3 - Danted Socks5 Test

```bash
curl -x socks5://<your_ip_server>:<your_danted_port> ifconfig.co
```

Example output of the command:

```bash
root@your_host:~# curl -x socks5://10.0.0.1:1080 ifconfig.co
10.0.0.1
```

If when doing a test it turns out that it failed, you can check the log is Danted on `/var/log/socks.log`

## Step 3 - Limit Acess Danted Proxy Socks5 (Optional)

In the previous danted configuration, we give public access to all IPs to be able to connect to our proxy server. At this step, we will only limit access to one or several ip.

Edit Danted Configuration on `/etc/danted.conf`, and change in this section :
```
client pass {
        from: 203.0.113.1/32 to: 0.0.0.0/0
        log: error connect disconnect
}
```

* `203.0.113.1/32` is single ip you want to allow access your proxy server.

If you want add another single ip again, just repeat a configuration.

```
client pass {
        from: 203.0.113.1/32 to: 0.0.0.0/0
        log: error connect disconnect
}
client pass {
        from: 198.51.100.1/32 to: 0.0.0.0/0
        log: error connect disconnect
}
```

If you want to give 1 block of ip access directly, change the slash behind ip according to your ip block.

## Conclusion

Now your server is ready to be used as a proxy socks5 with the Danted application on Debian or Ubuntu.
